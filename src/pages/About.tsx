            Budi's mission is twofold: to build a new way to connect over food, and to make cooking healthy, nutritionally balanced meals at home easy and intuitive.

            <h3 className="text-base font-semibold text-black mb-3">Connect over food</h3>
            <p>
              Budi was created to let you share what you cook—what actually works for you—with your friends. It's a place to find inspiration for some of the most important choices you make every day—what you eat—from people you know and trust. While there's endless content available online, we rarely see what our closest friends are actually making at home.

            <h3 className="text-base font-semibold text-black mb-3">Make Healthy Cooking Easy</h3>
            <p>
              Making healthier choices becomes easier when you can see what actually works in real kitchens. Ultra-processed foods are in roughly half of all packaged products—and they're linked to obesity, heart disease, diabetes, and depression. Cutting them out of your diet shouldn't be so hard. Budi's goal is to make it easy and intuitive to cook healthy, balanced meals at home. The app provides AI-driven nutritional insights and helps you learn nutritional fundamentals by applying them to what you actually eat—turning abstract nutrition advice into practical knowledge you can use.

            <p>
              Budi handles the organization: track and organize your recipes, import new ones with AI, manage your ingredients and grocery lists. Browse a beautiful feed of what your friends are cooking, recommend recipes to each other, and share notes. Build your own culinary database over time.

        <h2 className="text-base font-semibold text-black mb-4 uppercase">Our Name</h2>
        <div className="space-y-6 text-secondary leading-relaxed text-justify text-sm">
          <p>
            Budi is named after a baby orangutan rescued by the International Animal Rescue (IAR) in December 2014 after being illegally kept as a pet for the first year of his life. When he was rescued, he was extremely weak and malnourished, but thanks to the IAR, Budi recovered and has since been released into the wild. You can read his story{' '}

            This app is not affiliated with the IAR nor the team that rescued Budi; however, I wanted to honor the incredible conservation and rehabilitation work being done to help orangutans like Budi and use this platform to raise awareness about the challenges orangutans face.
          </p>
          <p>
            Orangutans are critically endangered, with all three species—Bornean, Sumatran, and Tapanuli—facing possible extinction in the wild within the next 10-20 years without effective habitat protection. The primary threat is large-scale deforestation that destroys their rainforest habitat. Forests are cleared for logging, agriculture, and commodity crops—palm oil included—leaving orangutans with nowhere to go. When habitat disappears, orangutan mothers are often killed and their babies captured for the illegal pet trade. Many rescued orangutans, like Budi, suffer psychological and physical trauma from captivity and require long-term rehabilitation.

              <strong>Reducing consumption of ultra-processed foods.</strong> Palm oil appears in roughly half of all packaged foods, and the global demand—around 77 million tons annually—is a major driver of deforestation. Ultra-processed foods depend on a narrow set of industrially-produced crops, including palm oil, grown at massive scale.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Protecting intact rainforest habitat.</strong> Research analyzing conservation investments found that direct habitat protection and anti-poaching patrols deliver the greatest return on investment for maintaining wild orangutan populations.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            While certified "sustainable" palm oil exists, many conservation organizations and independent researchers have found that certification alone has not significantly reduced deforestation or meaningfully protected orangutan habitat. Multiple studies show that orangutan populations declined equally in both certified and non-certified plantations. The larger issue is the continued loss of rainforest—not the label on any one product.

          <div>
            <h3 className="text-base font-semibold text-black mb-3">The Connection to Whole Foods</h3>
            <p className="mb-4">
              What does help is reducing demand for products that rely heavily on industrialized monocultures and ultra-processed ingredients. Beyond their environmental impact, ultra-processed foods are linked to serious health issues including obesity, heart disease, type-2 diabetes, and depression. By cooking more with whole, unprocessed ingredients, we address both problems at once.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Budi is designed to make this shift easier. By giving you a simple, intuitive way to cook more meals at home—and rely less on ultra-processed foods—you naturally reduce your consumption of the ingredients and supply chains that harm orangutan habitats.
            </p>
            <p>
              Every home-cooked meal made with whole ingredients is a small step that adds up: it's better for your health, better for your wellbeing, and better for the ecosystems we depend on.
